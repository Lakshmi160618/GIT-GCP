If you get the following error message:

Failed to validate permissions required for default service account: '1021901109091-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com'. Cluster creation could still be successful if required permissions have been granted to the respective service accounts as mentioned in the document https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/concepts/configuring-clusters/service-accounts#dataproc_service_accounts_2. This could be due to Cloud Resource Manager API hasn't been enabled in your project '1021901109091' before or it is disabled. Enable it by visiting 'https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/overview?project=1021901109091'.
For PD-Standard without local SSDs, we strongly recommend provisioning 1TB or larger to ensure consistently high I/O performance. See https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/performance for information on disk I/O performance.
The firewall rules for specified network or subnetwork would allow ingress traffic from 0.0.0.0/0, which could be a security risk.

Then pls enable the API: Cloud Resource Manager API which 
Creates, reads, and updates metadata for Google Cloud Platform resource containers.
