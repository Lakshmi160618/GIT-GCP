Please ensure the following:

Image Information: Make sure that the image_family and image_project variables in your script match a valid image available in your GCP project. You can list the available images in your project using the gcloud command-line tool:

Copy code
gcloud compute images list
Find a suitable image and update the image_family and image_project accordingly.

Service Account Permissions: Ensure that the service account associated with your credentials file has the necessary permissions to create VM instances and access the specified image. You can grant the "Compute Instance Admin (v1)" role to the service account if it doesn't have the appropriate permissions.

Once you've verified and updated the image information and checked the service account permissions, try running the script again. If you encounter any further issues, please let me know, and I'll assist you further.
