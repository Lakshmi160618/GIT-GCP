Step 1. Project Directory Structure:

cloud-function-run-locally/
├── main.py
├── requirements.txt
├── simulate_event.py
├── .vscode/
│   └── launch.json


Step 2: Steps to Run and Debug

2.1 Install Dependencies:

Ensure you have all dependencies installed. You can create a virtual environment and install the dependencies using pip:
# pls run the following commands one by one
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt

2.2 Run Functions Framework Locally:

Start the Functions Framework to serve your Cloud Function locally:
# Navigate through to the folder in which you have gcf files
python -m functions_framework --target bucket_creator

2.3 Simulate Event:

In a separate terminal, run the simulation script to send an event to the local function:
# run the following command
python simulate_event.py

======================== Please use this following script =============================
Step 1: Creating vs code environement for gcloud and python:functions-framework
Step 2: pip install functions-framework
Step 3: You need to develop your code for the cloud function"
>>> Please use the following script for your main.py file:
import functions_framework

@functions_framework.http
def bq_to_gs_load(request):
    return 'The cloud function is debugged succeffully'

>>> Please update the requirements.txt file so it includes the required packages imported in main.py file

>>> you should have launch.json file for debuggging your code locally

{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Python: Functions Framework",
            "type": "python",
            "request": "launch",
            "module": "functions_framework",
            "args": ["--target", "bq_to_gs_load", "--source","D:\\CloudFunctions\\bq_to_gcs\\main.py"],
            "console": "integratedTerminal"
        }
    ]
}

Step 4: You need press cntrl + shipt + d (or F5)--> it is for the debugging:

>>> you need to select Python Debugger:

Step 5: You will be having the following project folder structure

CLOUDFUNCTION/
|__.vscode
|   |__launch.json
|__bq_to_gcs
|   |__main.py
|   |__requirements.txt
|__venv
